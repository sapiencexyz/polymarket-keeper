  return `Generate short names for these prediction markets.

UNDERSTANDING OUTCOMES:
- "outcomes" array = [YesSide, NoSide]
- outcomes[0] = what happens if market resolves YES (e.g., the winning team)
- outcomes[1] = the opposing side
- When outcomes are team names (not "Yes"/"No"), use outcomes[0] as the winner

RULES for "name" (shortName):
- MUST be answerable as Yes/No (MOST IMPORTANT - clarity over brevity!)
- NEVER use "vs" format for non-matchup questions - use "X wins" instead
- Should be under 20 characters when possible
- Use abbreviations: O/U, pts, reb, ast
- Team abbreviations when well-known: LAL, BOS, NYK, CHI, MIA, GSW, etc.

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- BAD: "KT vs PPLE" for "Will KT Party win most seats?" -> GOOD: "KT wins Thailand"
- BAD: "SDP vs LDP" for "Will SDP win most seats in Japan?" -> GOOD: "SDP wins Japan"
- BAD: "Chelsea vs Wav" for "Will Chelsea win?" -> GOOD: "Chelsea wins"
- BAD: "NE vs SEA" for coin toss question -> GOOD: "Coin toss NE"

MARKET TYPE FORMATS:

1. Team matchups (ONLY use "vs" when it's actually a head-to-head game):
   q: "Lakers vs Celtics", outcomes: ["Lakers","Celtics"] -> "LAL wins"

2. Single team/party win questions (NOT a matchup - use "wins"):
   - "Will Chelsea FC win?" -> "Chelsea wins"
   - "Will LDP win majority in Japan?" -> "LDP wins Japan"
   - "Will KT Party win most seats?" -> "KT wins Thailand"

3. Over/Under totals ("X vs Y: O/U 244.5"):
   -> "LAL/BOS O244.5"

4. Player props ("Player: Points Over 25.5"):
   -> "LeBron O25.5pts"

5. Spread markets ("Spread: Team (-3.5)"):
   -> "Lakers -3.5"

6. Price movement ("Asset Up or Down on Date"):
   -> "SOL up Jan14"

7. Other markets:
   - "Fed rate cut January?" -> "Fed cut Jan"
   - "Trump wins 2024?" -> "Trump 2024"

IMPORTANT: Never shorten or truncate the market ID - copy it exactly as provided.
